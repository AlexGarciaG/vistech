# Objectives.
The main objective of this project is to create a differential robot representing a car that will travel autonomously while following the basic traffic signs(speed limit, stop, turns ), other vehicles, traffic lights, and persons. 
The secondary objective is to implement a directional Akerman direction so the robot can more significantly represent actual car behavior. 

# Equitment used.
The section will list all the hardware and Software used so that any user can recreate this project. 
You could use different hardware, but it will impact the performance and behavior, which implies an adjustment in the Software.

## Software
The project must be installed on ROS noetic and ubuntu 20.04; in other environments, the project may not work correctly. 
## Hardware
This project was built using the following equipment:
Jetson Xavier Nx developer kit
Camera Web Logitech B5252
# Install Requirements
The following commands must be executed on the computer onboard (Jetson Xavier Nx)
### Software
Install ROS
### Packages
### Git

# Set up environment.
This section will be executed after all the requirements are installed; otherwise, it will work improperly or fail.
## Arduino
Upload the file [.......] to the Arduino Mega
## Joy
To setup, a remote controller executed the following commands extracted from [..........]
## Ready to go when turned on.
Follow this set of instructions so the Autonomous vehicle is ready to go when it is powered.
